# PATH9577Q Final Project
Christine's Final Project for Dr. Poon's PATH9577Q Introduction to Python in Bioinformatics Class

**Due:** August 3, 2018

**Description of This Program**

This program takes .csv files generated by FlowJo software for analyzing flow cytometry. 
It merges .csv files with similar headers to create a large "database". 
It also eliminates unnecessary rows in the file, including extra headers from merged files, 
empty compensation rows, and empty "Mean" and "SD" rows.

**Getting Started and Requirements**

Make sure you have python v3.x installed on your computer. Available [here](https://www.python.org/).
Also make sure that you have a UNIX-like computing environment. This program was built and tested using macOS.

**Description of Package Contents**

Within the folder, there are:
1. 1x README.md file (you are here)
2. 1x Program file (.py)
3. 3x Test .csv files of recently acquired flow cytometry data 

**Sample Input and Ouptut Photos**

Sample input (one file):

![alt text](https://github.com/christinecaron/PATH9577Q-Final-Project/blob/master/Reference%20Photos/PATH9577Q-Final-Project-sampleinput.png "Sample input")

Sample output (multiple merged files):

**How to Use This Program and Features**

If you run the program itself with no file entered into command line,
```shell
Christines-MacBook-Pro-2:Caron_Christine_PATH9577Q_FinalProject christinecaron$ python3 Caron_Final_Project.py
```
the program will provide you with a prompt:
```shell
Christines-MacBook-Pro-2:Caron_Christine_PATH9577Q_FinalProject christinecaron$ python3 Caron_Final_Project.py
Incorrect number of arguments. For usage information, enter: <python3> <Caron_Final_Project.py> <-h>
usage: Caron_Final_Project.py [-h] path additional usage
Caron_Final_Project.py: error: the following arguments are required: path, additional usage
```
It prompts that you have not entered a file you would like to merge. To receive information on how 
to run the program, enter the following:
```shell
Christines-MacBook-Pro-2:Caron_Christine_PATH9577Q_FinalProject christinecaron$ python3 Caron_Final_Project.py -h
usage: Caron_Final_Project.py [-h] path additional usage

Merge flow cytometry CSV files and clean up unnecessary lines.

positional arguments:
  path              <input> File name you would like to merge.
  additional usage  <example> python3 Caron_Final_Project.py <filename.csv>

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
```

Here, basically you are given instructions on a file to enter, and how to enter the arguments into the command line.

Ensure all files entered are of .csv format. Files that are not .csv will not run with this program,
and the program will prompt you to check the file extension.

Once this is entered, your first file will be added to 'merged_file_FINAL.csv'.
As you enter the files into the command line (I chose to do it this way since I typically only receive one flow 
cytometry output file per experiment), they will be added to 'merged_file_FINAL.csv' file and a database will be generated, 
with unnecessary rows removed from the file. 

**Authors and Contributions**

I am open to contributions from others to improve the program or to introduce new features to the program.
I appreciate Dr. Poon and Matt Hintermayer for suggestions and troubleshooting.
